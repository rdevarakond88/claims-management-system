# Claims Management System (CMS)

> A lightweight, learning-focused web application simulating real-world healthcare claims workflows between Providers, Payers, and CMS.

---

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project is a **Product Management learning initiative** designed to:
- Demonstrate end-to-end product thinking (from PRD to deployment)
- Simulate enterprise-grade healthcare claims processing
- Showcase AI-assisted product development workflows

**Built by:** [rdevarakond88](https://github.com/rdevarakond88)  
**Domain:** Healthcare IT (Payer/Provider Claims Management)  
**Tech Stack:** (To be determined in architecture phase)

---

## 🏥 What This System Does

The Claims Management System models the interaction between:

1. **Providers** (hospitals, clinics) — Submit claims for patient services
2. **Payers** (insurance companies like Humana, UnitedHealthcare) — Process and adjudicate claims
3. **CMS Proxy** (Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services) — Receive forwarded claims for reimbursement

### Core Workflows (MVP Scope)
- ✅ Claims Submission
- ✅ Claims Adjudication
- 🔄 Eligibility Verification
- 🔄 CMS Forwarding
- 🔄 Claims Status Tracking

## 📚 Documentation

All product and technical documentation lives in the `/docs` and `/architecture` folders:

- **[PRD (Product Requirements Document)](./docs/PRD.md)** — Full product specification
- **[System Design](./architecture/SYSTEM_DESIGN.md)** — Architecture overview
- **[Data Model](./architecture/DATA_MODEL.md)** — Database schema
- **[API Contracts](./architecture/API_CONTRACTS.md)** — Endpoint specifications

## 🧠 AI-Assisted Development

This project uses **Claude Code** and **GitHub MCP integration** for:
- Context-aware code generation
- Consistent implementation of requirements
- Automated documentation updates

Context files for AI assistants are stored in `/context-for-ai/`.

## 🛠️ Development Phases

### Phase 1: Product Requirements ✅ (In Progress)
- Define PRD with user personas, workflows, and acceptance criteria
- Establish data models and API contracts

### Phase 2: MVP Development 🔄 (Next)
- Build core submission and adjudication flows
- Implement basic UI for providers and payers
- Set up database and backend API

### Phase 3: DevOps & Deployment 📋 (Planned)
- Containerize with Docker
- Set up CI/CD pipeline
- Implement monitoring (Prometheus, Grafana)
