# Project Overview: Claims Management System

> **Purpose:** This document provides context for AI-assisted development tools (like Claude Code) to understand the project's goals, domain, and constraints.

---

## üéØ What We're Building

A **lightweight Claims Management System (CMS)** that simulates real-world healthcare claims processing workflows.

**Core Purpose:**
- Educational/portfolio project demonstrating product management skills
- Functional prototype showing understanding of payer-provider claims flows
- Showcase for AI-assisted product development

---

## üè• Domain Context: Healthcare Claims Processing

### Key Entities
1. **Provider** ‚Äî Hospitals, clinics, or physicians who deliver patient care
2. **Payer** ‚Äî Insurance companies (e.g., Humana, UnitedHealthcare) who reimburse providers
3. **CMS** ‚Äî Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (government entity managing federal healthcare programs)

### The Claims Flow (Simplified)
```
Patient receives care at Provider
    ‚Üì
Provider submits claim to Payer (with CPT codes, ICD-10 diagnosis, patient info)
    ‚Üì
Payer adjudicates claim (verifies eligibility, coverage, calculates reimbursement)
    ‚Üì
Payer approves/denies claim
    ‚Üì
For Medicare/Medicaid: Payer forwards approved claims to CMS for reimbursement
    ‚Üì
Payer sends remittance advice to Provider (payment details)
```

### Real-World Complexity (We're Simplifying)
- Actual systems handle millions of claims per day
- Complex eligibility rules, prior authorization, appeals processes
- HIPAA compliance, EDI 837/835 formats, integration with clearinghouses
- **Our MVP:** Focus on core submission ‚Üí adjudication ‚Üí approval/denial flow

---

## üë• User Personas (Simplified for MVP)

### 1. Provider User (Primary)
- **Role:** Claims submission specialist at a clinic
- **Goal:** Submit claims quickly, track status, understand denials
- **Pain Points:** Manual data entry, unclear denial reasons, delayed payments

### 2. Payer User (Claims Processor)
- **Role:** Claims adjudicator at insurance company
- **Goal:** Review claims efficiently, apply coverage rules, minimize fraud
- **Pain Points:** High claim volume, complex eligibility rules, provider disputes

### 3. System Admin (Internal)
- **Role:** IT/Operations team managing the platform
- **Goal:** Monitor system health, manage user accounts, troubleshoot issues

---

## üîß MVP Scope (Phase 1)

### Core Workflows
1. **Claims Submission** (Provider ‚Üí Payer)
   - Provider enters claim data via web form
   - System validates required fields
   - Claim status set to "Submitted"

2. **Claims Adjudication** (Payer reviews)
   - Payer sees queue of submitted claims
   - Can approve (set reimbursement amount) or deny (with reason)
   - Claim status updates to "Approved" or "Denied"

3. **Claims Status Tracking** (Provider checks)
   - Provider can view list of their submitted claims
   - See current status and any payer notes

### Out of Scope (for MVP)
- Eligibility verification API
- Real-time CMS forwarding
- EDI file parsing (we'll use manual forms)
- Appeals/resubmission workflow
- Payment processing
- Real HIPAA compliance (we'll simulate with basic auth)

## üóÑÔ∏è Core Data Entities

### Claim
- **ID:** Unique identifier
- **Provider ID:** Who submitted
- **Patient Info:** Name, DOB, Member ID
- **Service Details:** CPT codes, diagnosis (ICD-10), service date, billed amount
- **Status:** Submitted | Under Review | Approved | Denied | Paid
- **Payer Decision:** Approved amount, denial reason, adjudication date

### Provider
- **ID:** Unique identifier
- **Name:** Clinic/hospital name
- **NPI:** National Provider Identifier
- **Contact Info:** Email, phone

### Payer
- **ID:** Unique identifier
- **Name:** Insurance company name
- **Contact Info:** Email, phone

### User
- **ID:** Unique identifier
- **Email:** Login credential
- **Role:** Provider Staff | Payer Claims Processor | Admin
- **Associated Entity:** Provider ID or Payer ID

---

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Approach

### Architecture Style
- **Frontend:** Web app (React or Vue.js) ‚Äî responsive, form-heavy
- **Backend:** REST API (Node.js/Express or Python/Flask)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL or MongoDB
- **Deployment:** Docker containers, eventually Kubernetes

### Key Principles
- **Stateful:** Claims persist in database with status transitions
- **Role-based access:** Providers see only their claims, Payers see all claims for their org
- **Audit trail:** Track who changed claim status and when
- **API-first:** Frontend consumes backend API (allows future mobile app)

---

## üö´ Constraints & Guardrails

### What to Avoid
- **No real PHI/PII:** Use dummy patient data only
- **No real payment processing:** Simulate with status updates
- **No production security:** Basic auth is fine (not OAuth2)
- **No over-engineering:** Prioritize working prototype over perfect code

### What to Prioritize
- **Clear data flow:** Easy to trace a claim from submission to adjudication
- **Readable code:** Well-commented, modular, easy for non-devs to understand
- **Extensibility:** Structure allows adding features (eligibility check, appeals) later

---

## üìã Success Criteria

This MVP is successful if:
1. A provider user can submit a claim via web form
2. A payer user can review and approve/deny the claim
3. The provider can see the updated status
4. All data persists correctly in the database
5. The system can be demo'd in an interview/portfolio review

## üß† AI Development Context

When generating code for this project:
- **Read the PRD first** (`/docs/PRD.md`) for feature requirements
- **Check the data model** (`/architecture/DATA_MODEL.md`) for entity structure
- **Follow API contracts** (`/architecture/API_CONTRACTS.md`) for endpoint specs
- **Apply coding guidelines** (`/context-for-ai/CODING_GUIDELINES.md`) for consistency

**Remember:** This is a learning project. Prioritize clarity and functionality over optimization.
