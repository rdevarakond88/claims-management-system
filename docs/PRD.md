## 1. Executive Summary

### What We're Building
A lightweight web application that simulates the end-to-end claims management workflow between healthcare providers, insurance payers, and government entities (CMS).

### Why We're Building It
- **Learning Goal:** Demonstrate product management capabilities through a real-world domain (healthcare claims)
- **Portfolio Piece:** Showcase ability to translate domain expertise into executable product requirements
- **Technical Demonstration:** Prove proficiency in AI-assisted product development and DevOps practices

### Who It's For
- **Primary Users:** Providers (claims submission staff), Payers (claims processors)
- **Secondary Users:** System administrators
- **Audience:** Hiring managers, product teams, technical interviewers

### Key Success Metric
A functional MVP where providers can submit claims, payers can adjudicate them, and both parties can track status‚Äîall demonstrable in a 10-minute product demo.

---

## 2. Problem Statement

### Current State (Real-World Context)
Healthcare claims processing involves:
- Providers submitting thousands of claims monthly to multiple payers
- Manual data entry prone to errors and rejections
- Opaque status tracking leading to payment delays
- Complex adjudication rules causing frequent denials
- Lack of real-time communication between providers and payers

### Pain Points

#### For Providers
- ‚ùå **Slow reimbursement cycles** ‚Äî Average 30-45 days from submission to payment
- ‚ùå **High denial rates** ‚Äî 15-20% of claims denied on first submission
- ‚ùå **Unclear rejection reasons** ‚Äî Generic denial codes without actionable guidance
- ‚ùå **Manual status checking** ‚Äî Calling payer support or checking disparate portals

#### For Payers
- ‚ùå **High claim volumes** ‚Äî Millions of claims requiring review
- ‚ùå **Fraud risk** ‚Äî Need to validate services were actually provided
- ‚ùå **Complex eligibility rules** ‚Äî Must verify coverage, prior auth, medical necessity
- ‚ùå **Provider disputes** ‚Äî Appeals and resubmissions add operational cost

### What Success Looks Like
A system where:
- Providers submit claims in under 5 minutes with clear validation feedback
- Payers process claims efficiently with structured decision workflows
- Both parties have real-time visibility into claim status
- System maintains audit trail for compliance and dispute resolution
