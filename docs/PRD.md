## 1. Executive Summary

### What We're Building
A lightweight web application that simulates the end-to-end claims management workflow between healthcare providers, insurance payers, and government entities (CMS).

### Why We're Building It
- **Learning Goal:** Demonstrate product management capabilities through a real-world domain (healthcare claims)
- **Portfolio Piece:** Showcase ability to translate domain expertise into executable product requirements
- **Technical Demonstration:** Prove proficiency in AI-assisted product development and DevOps practices

### Who It's For
- **Primary Users:** Providers (claims submission staff), Payers (claims processors)
- **Secondary Users:** System administrators
- **Audience:** Hiring managers, product teams, technical interviewers

### Key Success Metric
A functional MVP where providers can submit claims, payers can adjudicate them, and both parties can track status—all demonstrable in a 10-minute product demo.

---

## 2. Problem Statement

### Current State (Real-World Context)
Healthcare claims processing involves:
- Providers submitting thousands of claims monthly to multiple payers
- Manual data entry prone to errors and rejections
- Opaque status tracking leading to payment delays
- Complex adjudication rules causing frequent denials
- Lack of real-time communication between providers and payers

### Pain Points

#### For Providers
- ❌ **Slow reimbursement cycles** — Average 30-45 days from submission to payment
- ❌ **High denial rates** — 15-20% of claims denied on first submission
- ❌ **Unclear rejection reasons** — Generic denial codes without actionable guidance
- ❌ **Manual status checking** — Calling payer support or checking disparate portals

#### For Payers
- ❌ **High claim volumes** — Millions of claims requiring review
- ❌ **Fraud risk** — Need to validate services were actually provided
- ❌ **Complex eligibility rules** — Must verify coverage, prior auth, medical necessity
- ❌ **Provider disputes** — Appeals and resubmissions add operational cost

### What Success Looks Like
A system where:
- Providers submit claims in under 5 minutes with clear validation feedback
- Payers process claims efficiently with structured decision workflows
- Both parties have real-time visibility into claim status
- System maintains audit trail for compliance and dispute resolution

## 3. Product Vision & Goals

### Vision Statement
*"To create a transparent, efficient, and user-friendly claims management platform that reduces friction between healthcare providers and payers while demonstrating modern product development practices."*

### Product Goals (Prioritized)

#### Phase 1 (MVP) — Core Submission & Adjudication
1. **Enable claims submission** — Providers can submit claims via web form with required fields
2. **Enable claims adjudication** — Payers can review, approve, or deny claims with rationale
3. **Provide status transparency** — Both parties see real-time claim status
4. **Maintain data integrity** — All actions are logged with timestamps and user attribution

#### Phase 2 (Future) — Enhanced Workflows
5. **Eligibility verification** — Pre-submission check if patient is covered
6. **CMS forwarding simulation** — Auto-forward approved Medicare claims to CMS proxy
7. **Appeals handling** — Providers can contest denials with additional documentation

#### Phase 3 (Future) — Advanced Features
8. **Analytics dashboard** — Aggregate views of denial trends, processing times
9. **Notifications** — Email/SMS alerts on status changes
10. **Bulk operations** — Upload claims via CSV or EDI file

## 5. User Journeys & Workflows

*(To be detailed in next iteration)*

### Workflow 1: Claims Submission (Provider)
1. Provider logs in → dashboard
2. Clicks "Submit New Claim"
3. Fills form (patient info, CPT codes, diagnosis, amount)
4. System validates required fields
5. Submits → claim status = "Submitted"
6. Confirmation shown with claim ID

### Workflow 2: Claims Adjudication (Payer)
1. Payer logs in → sees queue of submitted claims
2. Clicks claim to review details
3. Decides: Approve or Deny
4. If approve: enters approved amount
5. If deny: selects denial reason
6. Submits decision → claim status updates
7. Provider sees updated status in their dashboard

### Workflow 3: Status Tracking
1. User (provider or payer) logs in
2. Views list of claims filtered by status
3. Clicks claim for detailed view
4. Sees timeline of status changes

---

## 6. Functional Requirements

### FR-1: User Authentication & Authorization
- Users must log in with email and password
- Role-based access: Provider, Payer, Admin
- Providers see only their own claims
- Payers see all claims (or filtered by payer organization)
- Admins see all data and manage users
- **User Onboarding (Admin-Provisioned):**
  - Admin creates user accounts via admin dashboard
  - System auto-generates secure temporary password (12+ chars)
  - Temporary password displayed once to admin (not retrievable later)
  - Admin manually shares temp password with new user
  - On first login, user forced to set permanent password
  - Cannot access system until password changed
  - Passwords must meet strength requirements (min 8 chars, uppercase, lowercase, number)
- Session-based authentication with 30-minute timeout
- Passwords hashed with bcrypt before storage

### FR-2: Claims Submission
- Provider can create new claim with fields:
  - Patient: Name, DOB, Member ID
  - Service: CPT code(s), ICD-10 diagnosis, service date, billed amount
  - Provider info: Auto-filled from logged-in user's profile
- System validates required fields before submission
- Unique claim ID generated upon submission
- Initial status set to "Submitted"

### FR-3: Claims Adjudication
- Payer can view list of submitted claims
- Payer can click claim to see full details
- Payer can approve claim:
  - Enter approved amount (≤ billed amount)
  - Add optional notes
  - Status changes to "Approved"
- Payer can deny claim:
  - Select denial reason from dropdown
  - Add optional detailed explanation
  - Status changes to "Denied"
- All decisions timestamped and attributed to payer user

### FR-4: Claims Status Tracking
- Both provider and payer can view claim list
- Filters: Status (all, submitted, approved, denied), date range
- Each claim shows: ID, patient name, service date, amount, status
- Click claim to see detailed view with history log

### FR-5: Data Persistence
- All claims stored in database
- Status transitions logged with timestamp and user
- Audit trail queryable for compliance

### FR-6: AI-Powered Claim Priority Categorization
- **Objective:** Automatically categorize claims by priority to optimize payer review workflow
- **Trigger:** Runs during claim submission (before database save)
- **Priority Levels:**
  - 🔴 **Urgent** — Emergency procedures, high-cost claims (>$5,000), critical diagnoses, time-sensitive treatments
  - 🟡 **Standard** — Routine hospitalizations, moderate-cost procedures ($500-$5,000), non-emergency medically necessary care
  - 🟢 **Routine** — Preventive care, annual checkups, low-cost procedures (<$500), non-urgent follow-ups
- **AI Analysis Input:**
  - CPT code (procedure type)
  - ICD-10 code (diagnosis severity)
  - Billed amount
  - Clinical urgency indicators
- **Business Rules:**
  - Priority stored as part of claim record
  - Payer dashboard sorts claims by priority (Urgent → Standard → Routine)
  - Provider sees assigned priority in claim details
  - If AI service fails, default to "Standard" priority and log error
  - Categorization must complete within 2 seconds
- **Success Criteria:**
  - 95%+ AI categorization accuracy (validated against manual review sample)
  - Payers process urgent claims within 24 hours
  - Average time-to-payment reduced for high-priority claims

- `PATCH /api/claims/:id/adjudicate` — Approve or deny claim
- `GET /api/users/profile` — Get logged-in user info
- `GET /api/admin/users` — List all users (admin only)
- `POST /api/admin/users` — Create user with temp password (admin only)

### AI Integration
- **Internal Service:** AI Categorization Service
