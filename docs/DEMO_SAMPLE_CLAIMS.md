## 📊 Expected Confidence Ranges

Based on production testing:

| Priority | Confidence Range | Characteristics |
|----------|-----------------|-----------------|
| URGENT   | 85-95%          | Clear emergency indicators: CPT 99285, 99291, or critical ICD-10 codes like I21 (heart attack), I63 (stroke) |
| STANDARD | 78-88%          | Moderate procedures: diagnostic imaging, scheduled surgery, therapy with $500-$5000 cost |
| ROUTINE  | 86-94%          | Clear preventive indicators: annual wellness (Z00.00), immunizations (Z23), low cost <$500 |

**Note**: Confidence varies based on ambiguity. Clear cases (emergency heart attack, annual wellness) get 90%+. Borderline cases (expensive diagnostic test) get 75-85%.
